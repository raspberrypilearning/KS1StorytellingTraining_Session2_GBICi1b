## Task 1: Technical setup for the project

Check that you are prepared for the project. This step is the first in a series of tasks in order to ensure that the technical setup is arranged well in advance of your trial  and lesson delivery. You will need to install an app or software to the class devices and you may need to bring in expertise, seek permissions, or source additional hardware. 

**Devices and live demonstrations**
Ideally, all demonstrations of programming should be done live. Set up well in advance of the trial as you may need to bring in expertise, seek permissions, or source additional hardware. 

For tablets/iPad, you will be able to choose connectivity from bluetooth, WiFi or hardware (such as an HDMI AV adapter):
+ Android tablet — search online for "screen mirroring" with the make/model of your device.
+ iPad — follow [information on AirPlay](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204289) or [information on AV adapters](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202044). 
+ Desktop computer — it is possible to demonstrate from the teacher's interactive whiteboard or an alternative monitor using the [ScratchJr Emulator](https://jfo8000.github.io/ScratchJr-Desktop), which works on a desktop computer (Microsoft Windows or macOS). Teachers may choose to use a desktop emulator for the purpose of demonstrations with the pupils using tablets/iPads.

You should consider the practicalities of demonstration when creating the seating plan. There are real benefits to live demonstration. In advance of the demonstrations, we recommend that you practise modifying and creating the programs in ScratchJr that are referenced in the lessons. However, if live demonstration is not practical, each set of lesson slides offers an alternative to live demonstration. 

**ScratchJr**
Download the ScratchJr app on your chosen devices. Follow the relevant link below: 
+ Android device such as tablets — [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.scratchjr.android&hl=en_GB)
+ iPad — [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scratchjr/id895485086)
+ Desktop computer — [emulator](https://jfo8000.github.io/ScratchJr-Desktop). The link gives information on the latest install for Mac or Windows computers.

For all activities in these units, learners can work in pairs. If pupils are sharing devices, organise pupils' seating in advance to allow for pairings. If you choose for pupils to work in pairs and there is an odd number of pupils, then three pupils can work together. Preallocate an area in the classroom for them, to ensure that they have plenty of space and a good monitor. Ensure that pairs take regular equivalent turns controlling their shared device so that one pupil does not dominate the other.
