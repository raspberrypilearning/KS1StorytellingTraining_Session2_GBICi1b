## Task 2: What's ScratchJr?
You can familiarise yourself with ScratchJr and the resources by completing the first lesson that the pupils will undertake.

Open [Unit 1 – Story-writing – Lesson 1 – What's ScratchJr?](https://ncce.io/hR8aiz), which comprises a teacher-facing lesson plan and a slide deck. This lesson introduces you to the ScratchJr interface, including blocks, and sets the scene for Unit 1 by introducing characters and structure. In this lesson, you will create a simple computer program in which you make a character move.
