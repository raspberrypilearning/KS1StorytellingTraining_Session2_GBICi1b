## Task 2: What's ScratchJr?
You will familiarise yourself with ScratchJr and deepen your understanding of ScratchJr and the resources by completing the first lesson that the pupils undertake.

The first task is to undertake [Lesson 1, Unit 1, Story-writing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1b7wA-cY3q54rqUilU_Fd245pC95bfdfv?usp=sharing) (L1: What’s ScratchJr? Unit1_GBICi1b_KS1Storytelling). This lesson introduces you to both ScratchJr’s interface, including the blocks as well as set the scene for Unit 1 - introducing characters and structure in familiar songs. Lesson 1 will introduce you to the programming environment ScratchJr where you will create a simple computer program by moving a character.

For this first task, you will use two resources: the teacher-facing [lesson plan](http://ncce.io/uhZZcP) and the [presentation slides](http://ncce.io/cRWRfX), which are both in the Lesson 1, Unit 1 folder (note that the presentation slides label the activities in the top right-hand corner to help you navigate the lesson).
